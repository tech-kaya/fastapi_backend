‚úÖ OBJECTIVE: Submit Contact Form at {website_url} (ONLY ONCE per User)
USER DETAILS (DO NOT DUPLICATE):

Name: {user_data.get('name', '')}
Email: {user_data.get('email', '')}
Phone: {user_data.get('phone', '')}
Message: {user_data.get('message', '')}

üõë CRITICAL DUPLICATE PREVENTION
Before filling anything:
Check if this user/email has already submitted (look for thank-you messages, confirmation texts, or disabled forms).
If any sign of prior submission: ‚Üí STOP and report: "User has already submitted to this website" ‚Üí Action: done

üîç ENHANCED FIELD DETECTION & FILLING STRATEGY

üìù FIELD FILLING PRIORITY (Fill in this exact order):
1. **NAME FIELD** - Look for these selectors:
   - input[name*="name"], input[id*="name"], input[placeholder*="name"]
   - First text input in form, textarea[name*="name"]
   - Fill with: {user_data.get('name', '')}

2. **EMAIL FIELD** - Look for these selectors:
   - input[type="email"], input[name*="email"], input[id*="email"]
   - input[placeholder*="email"]
   - Fill with: {user_data.get('email', '')}

3. **PHONE FIELD** - Look for these selectors:
   - input[type="tel"], input[name*="phone"], input[id*="phone"]
   - input[placeholder*="phone"]
   - Fill with: {user_data.get('phone', '')}

4. **MESSAGE FIELD** - Look for these selectors:
   - textarea[name*="message"], textarea[id*="message"]
   - textarea[placeholder*="message"], textarea (any textarea)
   - Fill with: {user_data.get('message', '')}

üéØ FIELD FILLING TECHNIQUE:
For EACH field:
1. **LOCATE**: Use multiple selectors - try name, id, placeholder, type
2. **CLICK**: Click the field first to focus it
3. **CLEAR**: Clear any existing text (Ctrl+A, Delete)
4. **TYPE**: Type the data slowly and clearly
5. **VERIFY**: Check that text appears in the field
6. **RECORD**: Mentally note "filled [field_name]"

‚ö° FIELD FILLING RULES:
- **Wait 1 second** between each field
- **Try 3 different selectors** for each field if first fails
- **Don't skip required fields** - keep trying alternatives
- **Use placeholder text** as hints for field purpose
- **Fill dropdown fields** by selecting first reasonable option

üîß ALTERNATIVE FIELD STRATEGIES:
If standard selectors fail:
- Look for **form labels** and find associated inputs
- Try **tab navigation** to move between fields
- Use **visual cues** like field position (top to bottom)
- Check for **dynamic forms** that load after page load

üí° SMART FIELD DETECTION:
- **Name variations**: "full name", "first name", "your name", "contact name"
- **Email variations**: "email address", "e-mail", "contact email"
- **Phone variations**: "telephone", "mobile", "contact number"
- **Message variations**: "comment", "inquiry", "details", "description"
