üîç ENHANCED FIELD DETECTION & FILLING STRATEGY

üìù COMPREHENSIVE FIELD FILLING PRIORITY (Fill in this exact order):

1. **NAME FIELDS** - Look for these variations:
   - **Full Name**: input[name*="name"], input[id*="name"], input[placeholder*="name"]
   - **First Name**: input[name*="first"], input[id*="first"], input[placeholder*="first"]
