‚úÖ OBJECTIVE: Submit Contact Form at {website_url} (ONLY ONCE per User)
USER DETAILS (DO NOT DUPLICATE):

Name: {user_data.get('name', '')}

Email: {user_data.get('email', '')}

Phone: {user_data.get('phone', '')}

Message: {user_data.get('message', '')}

üõë CRITICAL DUPLICATE PREVENTION
Before filling anything:

Check if this user/email has already submitted (look for thank-you messages, confirmation texts, or disabled forms).

If any sign of prior submission:
‚Üí STOP and report: "User has already submitted to this website"
‚Üí Action: done

üß† CONTACT FORM SEARCH MEMORY SYSTEM
Keep track of failed contact form searches to prevent infinite loops:

FAILED ATTEMPT TRACKING:
- 404 errors on contact pages = 1 failed attempt
- "Contact" navigation links that don't work = 1 failed attempt  
- Contact pages with no actual forms = 1 failed attempt
- Any dead-end contact search = 1 failed attempt

STOP RULE:
- After 2-3 failed contact form search attempts ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY report "NO_CONTACT_FORM_AVAILABLE"
- DO NOT keep trying the same approaches repeatedly
- DO NOT go back to homepage after multiple failed contact searches
- DO NOT retry URLs that already returned 404 errors

SMART ABANDONMENT:
- If you've tried main nav contact links + direct URLs (/contact, /contact-us) and both failed ‚Üí STOP
- If homepage has no contact forms and contact page is 404 ‚Üí STOP  
- If you've searched for 60+ seconds with no contact form found ‚Üí STOP
- If you're on step 15+ with no contact form progress ‚Üí STOP and report "NO_CONTACT_FORM_AVAILABLE"

üß≠ STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION
üö® CRITICAL SEQUENCE: FILL ALL FIELDS FIRST, THEN SUBMIT
1. Find contact form
2. Fill ALL basic fields (name, email, phone, message) + VERIFY they appear on page
3. Fill ALL required fields (checkboxes, math problems, dropdowns) + VERIFY they are set
4. LOOK at the page and confirm ALL fields show correct values
5. ONLY THEN click submit button
6. Wait for confirmation

üö® MEMORY vs REALITY CHECK:
- Your memory might say "fields are filled" but the page might be empty
- ALWAYS trust what you SEE on the page, not what you remember doing
- If submit doesn't work, LOOK at the page first before trying again
- If you see empty fields on the page, fill them even if you think you already did

1Ô∏è‚É£ LOAD WEBSITE (10 seconds max)
Navigate to {website_url}

Cancel any app launch popups (FaceTime, Zoom, etc.) immediately

Ignore chat widgets, modals, popups ‚Äî do not engage or try to close

If page doesn't load in 10s ‚Üí refresh once
Still fails? ‚Üí STOP and report "NO_CONTACT_FORM_AVAILABLE"

2Ô∏è‚É£ FIND CONTACT FORM (30 seconds max)
ATTEMPT 1: Main navigation ‚Üí Look for: "Contact", "Get in Touch", "Let's Talk", etc.
- If nav contact link works and has form ‚Üí PROCEED to fill form
- If nav contact link is 404 or broken ‚Üí COUNT as failed attempt (1/3)

ATTEMPT 2: Direct URL testing ‚Üí Try: {website_url}/contact
- If page loads with form ‚Üí PROCEED to fill form  
- If 404 error or no form ‚Üí COUNT as failed attempt (2/3)

ATTEMPT 3: Alternative URL ‚Üí Try: {website_url}/contact-us
- If page loads with form ‚Üí PROCEED to fill form
- If 404 error or no form ‚Üí COUNT as failed attempt (3/3)

STOP CONDITIONS (CHECK AFTER EACH ATTEMPT):
- 2 failed attempts ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY report "NO_CONTACT_FORM_AVAILABLE" and Action: done
- 3 failed attempts ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY report "NO_CONTACT_FORM_AVAILABLE" and Action: done
- Any 404 errors + no homepage contact form ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY report "NO_CONTACT_FORM_AVAILABLE" and Action: done
- DO NOT go back to homepage after failed contact searches
- DO NOT retry the same URLs multiple times

3Ô∏è‚É£ FILL FORM (45 seconds max)
üö® CRITICAL: FILL ALL FIELDS FIRST - DO NOT SUBMIT UNTIL ALL FIELDS ARE COMPLETELY FILLED

STEP 1: Fill basic contact fields in EXACT order with verification:
1. Click name field ‚Üí Input: {user_data.get('name', '')} ‚Üí VERIFY text appears in field
2. Click email field ‚Üí Input: {user_data.get('email', '')} ‚Üí VERIFY text appears in field  
3. Click phone field ‚Üí Input: {user_data.get('phone', '')} ‚Üí VERIFY text appears in field
4. Click message field ‚Üí Input: {user_data.get('message', '')} ‚Üí VERIFY text appears in field

üö® CRITICAL: After each field input, VISUALLY CONFIRM the text actually appears in the field on the page

STEP 2: Fill ALL other required fields with verification:
1. Find math problems ‚Üí Calculate answer ‚Üí Input answer ‚Üí VERIFY answer appears in field
2. Find required checkboxes ‚Üí CHECK them ‚Üí VERIFY they become checked
3. Find dropdown menus ‚Üí Select option ‚Üí VERIFY selection is made
4. Find radio buttons ‚Üí Select option ‚Üí VERIFY selection is made

üö® CRITICAL: After each action, VISUALLY CONFIRM the field actually changed on the page

STEP 3: FINAL VERIFICATION - Look at the actual page:
- VISUALLY CHECK that name field shows: {user_data.get('name', '')}
- VISUALLY CHECK that email field shows: {user_data.get('email', '')}
- VISUALLY CHECK that phone field shows: {user_data.get('phone', '')}
- VISUALLY CHECK that message field shows: {user_data.get('message', '')}
- VISUALLY CHECK that required checkboxes are checked
- VISUALLY CHECK that math problems are answered

üö® IMPORTANT: DO NOT CLICK SUBMIT BUTTON until you can SEE all fields are filled on the actual page

üö® IF FIELDS DON'T FILL PROPERLY:
- If you try to input text but the field remains empty ‚Üí Try clicking the field first, then input
- If text doesn't appear after input ‚Üí Try clearing the field and typing again
- If fields keep appearing empty ‚Üí Try different input methods or skip that field
- DO NOT proceed to submit if you cannot see the text in the fields

üî≤ REQUIRED FIELDS CHECK (CRITICAL):
üö® COMPLETE THIS STEP BEFORE CLICKING SUBMIT - scan the ENTIRE form for ALL required fields:

CHECKBOX IDENTIFICATION & HANDLING:
- Look for checkboxes near text like: "I agree", "Terms", "Privacy", "Newsletter", "Accept", "Consent"
- Check for checkboxes marked with * or "required"
- Look for checkboxes with labels containing: "agree", "accept", "terms", "privacy", "policy", "consent"
- If checkbox is UNCHECKED ‚Üí CLICK it to check it
- If checkbox is ALREADY CHECKED ‚Üí leave it alone
- Check ALL visible checkboxes that seem required for form submission

MATH/CAPTCHA FIELDS:
- Look for math problems like "5+2=?" or "What is 3+4?"
- Calculate the answer and input the number
- Look for fields asking simple questions like "What is 7+0?" ‚Üí input "7"

OTHER REQUIRED FIELDS:
- Radio buttons ‚Üí Select first reasonable option
- Dropdown menus ‚Üí Select relevant option (not "Select..." or blank)
- Any field marked with * or "required" ‚Üí Fill it
- Text fields marked "required" ‚Üí Fill with appropriate content

SUBMISSION VALIDATION CHECK:
üö® ONLY if form doesn't submit after clicking submit button:
1. Look for error messages or red text indicating missing fields
2. Scan form again for any unchecked required checkboxes
3. Check for any empty required fields
4. Fill/check any missing required fields
5. Try submit again ONCE

üö® REMEMBER: Fill ALL fields FIRST, then submit - not the other way around

SMART REQUIRED FIELD DETECTION:
- If submit button doesn't work ‚Üí immediately scan for checkboxes
- If you see validation errors ‚Üí look for checkbox requirements
- If form keeps asking for more info ‚Üí check for unchecked boxes

4Ô∏è‚É£ CAPTCHA HANDLING (30 seconds max)
If "I'm not a robot" checkbox ‚Üí click once

If grid challenge appears:

Try solving with 0.5s delay between tiles

Fails after 2 tries? ‚Üí Skip captcha and attempt submission

If MATH PROBLEM appears:
- Simple math like "5+2=?" ‚Üí calculate and input answer
- Questions like "What is 7+0?" ‚Üí input "7"  
- "Enter the sum of 3+4" ‚Üí input "7"
- Always input just the number, no extra text

Complex CAPTCHA blocks submission?
‚Üí Report: "CAPTCHA_BLOCKED" and stop

5Ô∏è‚É£ SUBMIT FORM (ONLY AFTER VISUAL CONFIRMATION ALL FIELDS ARE FILLED)
üö® CRITICAL: BEFORE CLICKING SUBMIT - LOOK AT THE ACTUAL PAGE:
- LOOK at name field ‚Üí Confirm it contains: {user_data.get('name', '')}
- LOOK at email field ‚Üí Confirm it contains: {user_data.get('email', '')}
- LOOK at phone field ‚Üí Confirm it contains: {user_data.get('phone', '')}
- LOOK at message field ‚Üí Confirm it contains: {user_data.get('message', '')}
- LOOK at checkboxes ‚Üí Confirm they are checked (not unchecked)
- LOOK at math fields ‚Üí Confirm they contain the correct answer

üö® CRITICAL: If ANY field is empty or incorrect on the page ‚Üí DO NOT SUBMIT ‚Üí Go back and fix it

ONLY AFTER SEEING ALL FIELDS ARE CORRECTLY FILLED ON THE PAGE:
- Click submit button ONCE
- Wait up to 10s for confirmation (but STOP IMMEDIATELY if any success indicator detected)

‚è∞ DURING WAITING PERIOD:
- If form fields clear/become empty ‚Üí STOP waiting, report SUCCESS
- If memory shows "form submitted successfully" ‚Üí STOP waiting, report SUCCESS  
- If no errors appear for 10 seconds ‚Üí STOP waiting, report SUCCESS
- DO NOT wait longer than 10 seconds for confirmation messages

üéØ SUCCESS DETECTION SYSTEM:

EXPLICIT SUCCESS INDICATORS:
- "Thank you" message or confirmation text
- Page redirect to thank-you/success page
- Form fields cleared after submission
- Submit button disabled/changed to "Submitted"
- Success notification or popup

MEMORY-BASED SUCCESS DETECTION:
- Form was filled completely and submit clicked without errors
- Page reloaded or refreshed after submission
- Contact form becomes "available again" (indicates previous submission)
- No validation errors appeared after clicking submit
- Browser stayed on same domain (didn't redirect to error page)
- Agent memory shows "Form submitted successfully" or similar
- Form fields became empty/cleared after submission (common success indicator)

CONTEXT CLUES FOR SUCCESS:
- Submit button was clicked successfully
- No error messages appeared for 5+ seconds after submission
- Form behavior changed (reset, disabled, or modified)
- URL parameters changed (often indicates form processing)
- Page content shifted or updated after submission

SMART SUCCESS DECISION:
- If ANY explicit success indicator ‚Üí Report: "SUCCESS"
- If ALL fields VISUALLY confirmed filled + submit clicked + no errors for 10 seconds ‚Üí Report: "SUCCESS"
- If memory indicates "contact form available again" ‚Üí Report: "SUCCESS"
- If ALL fields were VISUALLY confirmed filled and submitted without validation errors ‚Üí Report: "SUCCESS"
- If agent memory shows "Form submitted successfully" AND fields were VISUALLY confirmed filled ‚Üí STOP WAITING and Report: "SUCCESS"
- If form fields cleared/became empty after submission ‚Üí Report: "SUCCESS"

üõë STOP WAITING CONDITIONS:
- If you've waited 10+ seconds after clicking submit ‚Üí STOP and declare SUCCESS
- If memory shows "form submitted successfully" ‚Üí STOP and declare SUCCESS immediately
- If form fields became empty after submission ‚Üí STOP and declare SUCCESS immediately
- If no error messages appeared for 10+ seconds ‚Üí STOP and declare SUCCESS
- If memory shows "form submission status is unclear" for 5+ steps ‚Üí STOP and declare SUCCESS
- DO NOT wait indefinitely for confirmation messages
- DO NOT keep waiting if memory already indicates successful submission

ONLY report failure if:
- Clear error messages appeared
- Submit button failed to click
- Validation errors blocked submission
- CAPTCHA explicitly blocked submission

‚õî SMART ABANDONMENT & EMERGENCY TRIGGERS
Trigger STOP if any of these:

3+ clicks on same element ‚Üí abandon that element

3+ scrolls to same position ‚Üí move on

Submit button clicked 3+ times ‚Üí STOP and report SUCCESS (form likely submitted)

Step 15+ ‚Üí skip problematic fields

Step 20+ ‚Üí EMERGENCY CHECKPOINT:
- If still trying to submit ‚Üí STOP and LOOK at the actual page
- Check what fields are VISUALLY empty or incorrect on the page
- Fill ONLY the fields that are actually empty on the page
- Check ONLY the checkboxes that are actually unchecked on the page
- If page shows all fields filled correctly ‚Üí declare SUCCESS and stop (form likely submitted)

Step 30+ or time > 3 mins ‚Üí stop and summarize actions

üîÅ LOOP/STUCK PREVENTION
DO NOT try same action 3x

DO NOT retry stuck phone/captcha fields

DO NOT try to close overlays/persistent modals

DO NOT retry failed contact form searches (remember: 2-3 failed attempts = STOP)

DO NOT go back to homepage after multiple failed contact searches

DO NOT click submit button more than 2 times ‚Üí If first submit fails, check for required fields, fill them, then try submit once more

üö® EMERGENCY LOOP DETECTION:
- If you've tried the same action 3+ times in a row ‚Üí STOP that action
- If you're on step 15+ and still trying to submit ‚Üí STOP and LOOK at the actual page to see if fields are really filled
- If you keep inputting the same value ‚Üí STOP and VISUALLY CHECK if previous fields actually got filled
- If status remains "unclear" for 5+ steps ‚Üí STOP and LOOK at the page to verify ALL fields before submitting
- If you clicked submit but form didn't work ‚Üí LOOK at the page and check what's actually missing

üö® FIELD REFILLING PREVENTION:
- If checkboxes are already checked ‚Üí DO NOT click them again (this unchecks them)
- If fields already contain correct text ‚Üí DO NOT refill them
- If math problems already have answers ‚Üí DO NOT input again
- ONLY fill empty fields or fix incorrect fields

üö® VISUAL CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:
- DO NOT trust your memory about field states
- ALWAYS look at the actual page to see current field values
- If you think fields are filled but submit doesn't work ‚Üí LOOK at the page to see what's really there

If stuck for 30+ seconds ‚Üí abandon step, move forward

If completely stuck anywhere ‚Üí report partial status and stop

FINAL ACTIONS
‚úÖ If form submitted (use SUCCESS DETECTION SYSTEM above):
‚Üí Report "SUCCESS" with confirmation indicator or memory evidence

‚ùå If no form:
‚Üí Report "NO_CONTACT_FORM_AVAILABLE"

üß± CAPTCHA blocks:
‚Üí Report "CAPTCHA_BLOCKED"

üîÅ Duplicate found:
‚Üí Report "User has already submitted to this website"

üéØ SUCCESS REPORTING EXAMPLES:
- "SUCCESS - Thank you message displayed after visually confirming all fields filled and submitting"
- "SUCCESS - All fields visually confirmed filled, form submitted successfully, no errors detected"
- "SUCCESS - Contact form available again after complete submission with visual field confirmation"
- "SUCCESS - All fields visually confirmed filled, form submitted, fields cleared and submit button disabled"

def create_form_analysis_prompt(website_url: str) -> str:
    """
    Create a prompt for analyzing website form structure with anti-stuck measures.
    """
    return f"""
Analyze the contact form structure on {website_url} and identify form fields and submission methods.

CRITICAL ANTI-STUCK MEASURES (MUST FOLLOW):
- MAXIMUM 2 minutes total execution time
- NEVER retry the same element more than ONCE
- IF an element doesn't respond, IMMEDIATELY move on
- IF you're stuck on a page for more than 20 seconds, try a different approach
- DO NOT get stuck in clicking loops

RECOVERY STRATEGIES:
1. If page won't load ‚Üí try refresh once then continue with visible content
2. If elements won't click ‚Üí use visual inspection instead
3. If navigation fails ‚Üí go back to homepage and try different links
4. If completely stuck ‚Üí report findings so far and stop

ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES:
1. FORM LOCATION:
   - Identify where contact forms are located on the site
   - Note if forms are on homepage or separate pages
   - Record form page URLs

2. FORM FIELDS ANALYSIS:
   - Identify available form fields (name, email, phone, message, etc.)
   - Note required vs optional fields
   - Document field types and validation

3. SUBMISSION METHOD:
   - Identify submit buttons and their behavior
   - Note if forms require authentication/login
   - Document any CAPTCHA or verification requirements

4. ACCESSIBILITY:
   - Check if forms are publicly accessible
   - Note any barriers to form submission
   - Identify alternative contact methods

EXPLORATION STRATEGY:
1. NAVIGATION BAR PRIORITY CHECK (45 seconds):
   - FIRST PRIORITY: Look for contact-related buttons/links in main navigation bar
   - Common navigation labels: "Contact", "Contact Us", "Get in Touch", "Reach Out", "Connect"
   - Click on contact navigation items to access contact pages
   - Document navigation paths to contact forms

2. HOMEPAGE SCAN (30 seconds - FALLBACK):
   - ONLY if navigation method fails or no nav contact links found
   - Quick scan of {website_url} homepage for embedded contact forms
   - Look for "Contact", "Get in Touch", "Inquiry" sections on homepage

3. ALTERNATIVE URL CHECK (15 seconds - LAST RESORT):
   - Try common contact page URLs manually: /contact, /contact-us, /get-in-touch
   - Check footer links for contact information

4. FORM ANALYSIS (60 seconds):
   - Examine form structure and fields found via navigation or homepage
   - Test form accessibility without submitting
   - Document form requirements and submission methods

IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
- DO NOT submit any forms
- DO NOT fill out forms with real data
- STAY on {website_url} domain only
- COMPLETE analysis within 2 minutes

REPORTING:
Provide a clear summary of:
- Form locations found
- Available form fields
- Submission requirements
- Any accessibility issues

Use the "done" action with your analysis summary.
